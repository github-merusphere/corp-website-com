  - title : "Flutter Framework"
    icon : "fas fa-desktop"
    icon_color : "primary" # available color : primary, yellow, purple, cyan, red, green, orange, blue.
    content : "The core of the Flutter app development kit is the Flutter framework. It offers a reactive UI framework, allowing developers to build visually appealing and responsive user interfaces using widgets. Flutter's framework leverages a 'hot reload' feature that enables developers to instantly see changes in the app as they code, reducing development time."
    
  - title : "Dart Programming Language"
    icon : "fas fa-cogs"
    icon_color : "primary" # available color : primary, yellow, purple, cyan, red, green, orange, blue.
    content : "Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is optimized for mobile app development. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based language with features like a just-in-time (JIT) compiler and garbage collection. It offers a familiar syntax for developers coming from languages like Java or JavaScript."
    
  - title : "Widget Library"
    icon : "fas fa-shield-alt"
    icon_color : "primary" # available color : primary, yellow, purple, cyan, red, green, orange, blue.
    content : "Flutter provides a rich set of pre-built UI widgets that can be customized and combined to create stunning user interfaces. Widgets in Flutter are highly customizable and can adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and platforms. The widget library includes basic components like buttons, text inputs, and containers, as well as more complex widgets like lists, grids, and animations."
    
  - title : "Code Reusability"
    icon : "fas fa-shield-alt"
    icon_color : "primary" # available color : primary, yellow, purple, cyan, red, green, orange, blue.
    content : "Custom widgets allow developers to encapsulate complex functionality and appearance into reusable components. Once created, custom widgets can be used multiple times throughout the application, reducing code duplication and promoting a modular development approach."
    
  - title : "Maintainability"
    icon : "fas fa-shield-alt"
    icon_color : "primary" # available color : primary, yellow, purple, cyan, red, green, orange, blue.
    content : "Custom widgets contribute to the maintainability of the codebase. By encapsulating specific functionality or visual representation, custom widgets create a separation of concerns. This separation makes it easier to locate, modify, and debug code related to a particular UI component."
    
  - title : "Hybrid Development"
    icon : "fas fa-shield-alt"
    icon_color : "primary" # available color : primary, yellow, purple, cyan, red, green, orange, blue.
    content : "SDK has unparalleled experience in hybrid mobile application development creating magic with codes. Our elite group of hybrid app developers creates a wide range of mobile apps."
