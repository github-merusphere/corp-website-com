      title : "Agile Development Methodology"
      content : "Agile application development is more suitable for larger projects. Agile is iterative, like Rapid Application Development, but focuses on building features individually. Each feature is built methodically by the team, but the customer is involved in seeing the features and signing off on them before the next feature is developed.


Agile uses sprints or when a certain feature should be built, tested, and presented. It tries to incorporate the entire SDLC for a feature into each sprint. Ideally, this helps stick to a planned schedule and allows frequent reviews. Agile doesn't focus on prototypes but only presents completed work after the sprint. So while the customer is informed more often than Waterfall, the customer only ever sees finished work, unlike RAD.


Agile project management methodology is also more team or squad-based. With RAD, you are working directly with a programmer. With Agile, the application development team will include testers, UX designers, technical writers, and others."
