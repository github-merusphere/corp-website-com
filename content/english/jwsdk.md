      content : "We provide professional services to Startups to design & develop a customised framework that enables all the engineers to focus on the actual product idea rather than the tools, technologies, Security, Deployment and processes in the day-to-day development. 


We concentrate more on creating the framework that enables even Fresh Graduates can start working without formal long classroom-like training. 


We provide a modularised framework such that we can choose the required modules for a given Product feature. 


We also provide the maintenance and support for the framework for security upgrades, application stack upgrades etc."
