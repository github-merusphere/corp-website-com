### Introduction

When a customer shops online they want the cushion of a smooth payment gateway refund process and easy returns. In a way, it is required, because the customer is not able to touch or feel or experience the product or service when they buy it and if it does not match his requirements they would not want their money to be wasted. On the other hand, the customers take undue advantage of these services and so the merchants need to keep a strict refund and return policy as per their business model
